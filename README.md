# Zane Knightwood's Portfolio
Hi, I'm Zane and this is my portfolio. I recently graduated from Western Governors University (Dec '23) with a BS in Computer Science.

Eventually, this repository will be converted into a website that will host different projects I've created using Python and Djanog. For now, this repository only holds one project, the ZK Book Recommender, which is described below.

You can contact me and find my work history via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zane-knightwood).

Thanks!

## Projects In This Repository:
